# Concepts

This section covers the core concepts that power the Poll Automation System.

## AI-Powered Question Generation

At the heart of our platform is a sophisticated AI engine that understands and processes content.

*   **Content Ingestion**: The system can ingest content from various sources, including video URLs, text files, and direct text input.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Using advanced NLP models, the AI identifies key concepts, entities, and relationships within the content.
*   **Question Formulation**: Based on its analysis, the AI generates a variety of question types, such as multiple-choice, true/false, and open-ended questions.

## Real-time Polling

Our real-time polling feature transforms passive viewing into active participation.

*   **WebSocket Communication**: We use WebSockets to maintain a persistent connection between the presenter and participants, ensuring instant data transfer.
*   **Live Dashboard**: Presenters have access to a live dashboard that displays results as they come in, allowing for immediate feedback and discussion.

## Content Agnostic

The Poll Automation System is designed to be content-agnostic, meaning it can work with a wide range of subjects and formats. Whether it's a history lecture, a scientific paper, or a training manual, our platform can turn it into an interactive experience.
